# Tech Debt Backlog

Engineering investment opportunities identified by the Tech Lead across cycles.
Review when planning — items deferred 5+ cycles signal recurring friction.

| Cycle | Investment | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| 211 | **Quest scaffolding system**: Standardized flag naming, validation script, 3-state flag recipe. Not causing friction — revisit if quest-heavy cycles resume. | pending |
| 217→254 | **Config-driven species generator**: `scripts/generate_species.cjs` — JSON config → 18 files (cry_tables.inc skipped, cry_ids.h handles mapping). Validated: 18/19 check_species pass, idempotency check, dry-run mode. | done (C254) |
| 227→234 | **Palette recolor helper**: CLI tool (reads .pal + color mapping JSON → recolored output). Not blocking — Sprite Designer handles palette creation. | pending |
| 244 | **Rival R119 Stantler_Hoenn Lv25 gap**: Quick fix. | done (C245) |
| 245→253 | **Trainer swap validator → check_all**: `check_trainers` added to `make check_all` target. | done (C254) |
| 254 | Extend species generator from 19-file (check_species) scope to full 27-file pipeline (adding graphics pic tables, coordinate tables, palette tables, footprint table, still front pic table). The 8 additional graphics files are more complex (INCBIN paths with coordinate structs) but would eliminate ALL manual steps from species addition. Natural follow-up after the 19-file generator proves reliable. | pending |
