# Tech Debt Backlog

Engineering investment opportunities identified by the Tech Lead across cycles.
Review when planning — items deferred 5+ cycles signal recurring friction.

| Cycle | Investment | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| 104–112 | Dialogue integrity checker script (scripts/check_dialogue.sh) | done (C112) |
| 106–118 | Trainer data validation script (scripts/check_trainers.sh) | done (C118) |
| 118–127 | Trainer validation Make target (`make check_trainers`) | done (C127) |
| 126–127 | ASCII validation guard in Makefile | done (C127) |
| 129–133 | Move constant validator script — window passed, inline grep sufficed | dropped (C133) |
| 139–141 | Script dialogue linting Make target (`make check_scripts`) | done (C141) |
| 142–145 | Automated flag-chain validator (`make check_flags`) | done (C145) |
| 115–151 | **Legendary Encounter Template** (`data/scripts/legend_macros.inc`): Extract parameterized macros from 4 shipped encounters. Reduces future legendaries from ~80 to ~20 lines. **Scheduled: C156.** | scheduled |
| 147–151 | **Trainer ID Audit** (`scripts/find_unused_trainers.sh`): Cross-reference opponents.h, trainers.h, rematch tables, map scripts. TRAINERS_COUNT=885/885, only 2 known reclaimable IDs (#568, #853). **Scheduled: C157.** | scheduled |
| 121 | CheckMultipleFlags script macro: reusable macro for N-flag checks. Marginal benefit until patterns exceed 3 flags. | deferred |
